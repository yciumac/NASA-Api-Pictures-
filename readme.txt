# NASA API pictures of the day

Incorporating the NASA Api to get random astronomic pictures of the day. The results are formatted into cards with an image, title, Add to Favorites, description, date and copyright information. There are 10 cards as results. If we click on image, we can see that we can view the full resolution version of that image in a new tab. We also have the ability to add images to our Favorites pages. This is done using local storage. When clicking on Add to Favorites, a small pop-up window informs us that we have added the chosen image to Favorites. We can't add the same image twice. We can't add the same image twice. We can navigate to our Favorites page and see the images we have saved. We also have the option to remove a favorite and the page reloads from the top of the page. We have the option to go back to our main page with reloads the new images. We can also scroll down the page and press Load More, that it scroll back to the top of the page with 10 fresh images. These images are also lazy loaded in order to improve performance. It will only load the image when it comes close to being scrolled to. This project is also mobile responsive.
